# ðŸ“¦ Embed widget

Install the library as a dependency:

```bash
npm install embed-widget
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add embed-widget
```

Then import the library:

```js
import widget from "embed-widget";
```

And initialize it with an optional selector:

```js
const embed = new widget("https://example.com", "Button text!");
```

You can also use a CDN:

```
